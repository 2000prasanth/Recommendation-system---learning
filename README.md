# Recommendation Engine Project

This repository contains the code for a recommendation engine built from scratch as a learning project. The engine is designed to suggest items to users based on their preferences and past interactions. The implementation is inspired by the guide available on Analytics Vidhya, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying algorithms and system design.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
- Content-based filtering to suggest similar items.
- Hybrid system leveraging the strengths of both methods.

Please refer to the documentation for detailed setup and usage instructions. Happy coding!
